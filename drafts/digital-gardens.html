    <p>I stumbled upon the term "mental garden" while browsing github. Turns out there's a
webring<sup>[citation needed]</sup> of people cultivating their gardens online in public. As far as I can
tell a mental garden differs from a blog or a microblog by being organized in terms of "notes".
These notes are linked and backlinked (bidirectional links) together creating a sort of wiki.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultiver son jardin int√©rieur - tend to your internal garden</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Browsing through those gardens and remembering <a href="https://billwurtz.com/">Bill Wurtz's site</a> made me realize
this is the type of personal website that I was looking for for quite some time now. The thing is
I feel like one needs to be (or be seen as) an authority (as in someone to look up to) in order
to make their thoughts public.</p>
<p>And for something somewhat different - I enjoy Markdown as a writing format. I'm not even sure
if I've yet found a use-case where its limitations would be insurmountable (except for papers for
which I prefer LaTeX).</p>
<p>I'm simply afraid that if I start taking notes and publishing them, I'm going to stop at some point
and never come back. I don't think I'm a bottomless well of interesting ideas. That's why for now
I'm going to publish "longer" forms.</p>
<p>The fine line between accepting your limitations and underestimating your abilities.</p>
<p>I like the idea of comparing one's mind to a garden. A garden is personal, it's about nurture and
the journey, not the "end product". Is there an end product of a mind? A magnum opus might be one,
but do you really know you're working on a magnum opus? I sure don't.</p>
<p>I also like the idea of collecting and curating your personal canon of things you admire and come
back to (an example of a site embodying this idea would be

<p>Webring, or personal wiki, that cites/leads to other wikis.</p>
<h2>Obsidian</h2>
<p>I'm gonna try out obsidian synced with git. stored encrypted in a private repo?</p>
