So I've been slowly getting into coffee lately. Don't get me wrong, I'm still quite new. That's
precisely the reason I try and use recipes and charts made by experts (at least to me). But after
getting myself a second iteration of the classic [Porlex Mini](https://www.porlexgrinders.com/)
grinder I realized grind sizes (or actually the number of *clicks*) still refer to the previous
version of Porlex Mini. Naturally, I wrote an email to the creator of [Honest Coffee Guide](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/)

## Grind sizes

What...
