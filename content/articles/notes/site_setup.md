Title: Site setup
Date: 2021-08-11
Summary: TODO
Status: draft

> cultiver son jardin int√©rieur - tend to your internal garden

- talk about how I like tinkering and tweaking small things and how much time I waste on this
- be kind and non-pretentious
- talk about how I made this site and why I don't use jekyll anymore
- no js

## Theme

The theme itself is quite simple. My main inspiration was the [solar][ltm-gh] theme, developed by 
*Marie Otsuka* for the [solar-powered version of Low-Tech Magazine][ltm]. They actually provide some 
[interesting insight][ltm-ab] into the decisions behind the design.

Another source of inspiration was [Buttercup Festival][bcf] by *David Troupe* - a web comic which I
wholeheartedly admire for its humour and calmness. I think the simple design (especially colours,
which I stole without any shame) captures the calmness very well.

## Accessibilty

- talk about javascript and usefulness
- talk about how big sites affect slow-interneted users (like myself back in my hometown)

### Minimizing size

As a first step, `normalize.css` is retrieved from a popular CDN. The theme is built, assuming
`normalize.css` will remain present.

- CSS is generated by `libsass` and minified with `cssmin`.
- It utilizes `webassets` [URL expiry feature][webass]
