These are my *subjective* notes on coffee (mainly specialty coffee from polish roasters). I try to
use some *standardized* terms (body, acidity, sweetness, bitterness, finish) to my best extent but I
still consider myself a layman. Up to this day I've had the opportunity to try [HAYB][hayb],
[the WHITE BEAR][whitebear], [Audun Coffee][audun], [Bonanza Coffee Roasters][bonanza], and
[Good Coffee][good].

## Recipes

**TODO:** Write down or link recipes I find enjoyable.

## Index

### [Audun Cofee][audun] Kenya Kamwangi (*drip*)

- Café: [Dzienna Dawka, Starogard Gdański][dziennadawka].
- Setup: Origami dripper.
- Profile: Low sweetness, red fruit - cherries?, smoked plums?
- General notes: **Super** tasty, but requires a lot of attention. I'd say these types of intense
brews suit me better for a café visit rather than an everyday morning sip.

### [Bonanza Coffee Roasters][bonanza] Kenya (*espresso*)

- Café: [Body Espresso Bar, Kraków][bodykrakow].
- Setup: espresso.
- Profile: Super acidic, super full, *syrupy* body, raspberries, brown sugar, fresh rhubarb.
- General notes: one of my biggest coffee experiences lately, s/o [@body.espressobar][bodykrakow].

### [Good Coffee][good] Columbia (*drip*)

- Café: [Fawory, Warszawa, Żoliborz][fawory].
- Setup: A funny drip machine. I can't remember the name.
- Profile: PLUM, low sweetness.
- General notes: *Very* tasty.

### [HAYB][hayb] Etiopia Odaco (*drip*)

- Setup: Aeropress, [HAYB][hayb]'s inverted method.
- Profile: Very sweet, incredible red fruits (strawberries), almost no bitterness.
- Mouthfeel: Very light but not tea-like.
- General notes: *Super tasty*, unfortunately not sold anymore.

### [HAYB][hayb] Honduras Evin Moreno (*drip*)

- Setup: Aeropress, [HAYB][hayb]'s inverted method.
- Profile: Kinda sweet, a little tart, acidity reminds me of ripe peaches.
- Mouthfeel: Light but a bit oily body. Might be my go-to for aeropress.
- General notes: Very nice, would buy again.

### [HAYB][hayb] Kostaryka Cordillera De Fuego (*drip*)

- Setup: Aeropress, [HAYB][hayb]'s inverted method.
- Profile: cinnamon, orange-like acidity, a little bitter.
- General notes: I couldn't get rid of the bitterness.

### [HAYB][hayb] Guatemala (*espresso*)

- Setup: Moka pot.
- Profile: Chocolate, vanilla, a little fruity, full body.
- Mouthfeel: A little too tart.
- General notes: *Tasty*. I think I prefer a lighter body and more fruitiness?

### [HAYB][hayb] Brazylia Espresso (*espresso*)

- Setup: Moka pot.
- Profile: Caramel, chocolate, raisins, medium body.
- General notes: Tasty but not *special*. I prefer HAYB's Guatemala.

### [HAYB][hayb] Black espresso blend (*espresso*)

- Setup: moka pot.
- Profile: Dark chocolate, nuts, low acidity.
- General notes: I'd say kinda classic?. Cool as a base for neutral *ghetto cappucciono*.

### [the WHITE BEAR][whitebear] Kolumbia Medellin (*espresso*)

- Setup: Moka pot.
- Profile: Rather low sweetness, bitter, probably a dark roast, chocolate.
- General notes: Nothing really interesting as for my taste. For a daily driver I prefer HAYB's
Guatemala.

### [the WHITE BEAR][whitebear] Brazylia: Fazenda Rainha (*espresso*)

- Setup: Moka pot.
- Profile: Hazelnut, low acidity.
- General notes: Long finish. When diluting with water, on the one hand, it gets tastier, but on the
other, it *loses intensity and finish* surprisingly quickly. At the end of the day it's quite
pleasant and nutty.

### [the WHITE BEAR][whitebear] Meksyk: El Triunfo (*espresso*)

- Setup: Moka pot.
- Profile: Acidic but still bitter. Buckwheat honey.
- General notes: Weird finish. I'm not 100% sold.

### [the WHITE BEAR][whitebear] Winter espresso (*espresso*)

- Setup: Moka pot / french press.
- General notes: A lot of dust, very bitter, not my taste.

## Setup

### Aeropress

- .

### *Bialetti* Moka Express

- Size: 3 cups.
- In my humble opinion, a great piece of *Art déco*. Turns out it's a part of
[MoMA permanent collection][moma-moka].

### *Porlex* Mini II

- `TODO: grind size chart.`

### *Ikea UPHETTA* French press

- Used mainly as a ghetto milk frother (**Oat milk** seems to work best with this one).
- Medium-coarse grind. 30 g of coffee / 500 g of water.
- Let it sit for 4 minutes, then scoop the foam and fines from the top, stir gently, and let it sit
again for 6 minutes.
    - From [James Hoffman's recipe][jh-french]

## Past

### Adam's tiny (*1 cup*) moka pot

- Pour in **hot water** just under the safety valve.
    - Hot water makes the brewing process quicker, minimizing the time of heating ground beans, and
    in turn, minimizing the bitterness.
- Add around 5 g of coffee without tampering.
- Straight on the burner.
- Cool down under cold water and pour into a cup.

### Some cheap burr grinder from *Tchibo*

- No lid, so coffee springs out while grinding.
- Not quite a uniform grind.
- Weird way of setting grind size.
- But it works.
