Title: Digital gardens

I stumbled upon the term "mental garden" while browsing github. Turns out there's a
webring<sup>[citation needed]</sup> of people cultivating their gardens online in public. As far as I can
tell a mental garden differs from a blog or a microblog by being organized in terms of "notes".
These notes are linked and backlinked (bidirectional links) together creating a sort of wiki.

Browsing through those gardens and remembering [Bill Wurtz's site](https://billwurtz.com/) made me realize
this is the type of personal website that I was looking for for quite some time now. The thing is
I feel like one needs to be (or be seen as) an authority (as in someone to look up to) in order
to make their thoughts public.

And for something somewhat different - I enjoy Markdown as a writing format. I'm not even sure
if I've yet found a use-case where its limitations would be insurmountable (except for papers for
which I prefer LaTeX).

I'm simply afraid that if I start taking notes and publishing them, I'm going to stop at some point
and never come back. I don't think I'm a bottomless well of interesting ideas. That's why for now
I'm going to publish "longer" forms.

The fine line between accepting your limitations and underestimating your abilities.

I like the idea of comparing one's mind to a garden. A garden is personal, it's about nurture and
the journey, not the "end product". Is there an end product of a mind? A magnum opus might be one,
but do you really know you're working on a magnum opus? I sure don't.

I also like the idea of collecting and curating your personal canon of things you admire and come
back to (an example of a site embodying this idea would be

Webring, or personal wiki, that cites/leads to other wikis.

## Obsidian

I'm gonna try out obsidian synced with git. stored encrypted in a private repo?
